Archiver
========

Utility for archiving files.

Archive Log
-----------
Log comments are saved in an <code>\_\_archive\_info\_\_.txt</code> file located in the top-level of the archive. The log uses [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) formatting.

Timestamps
----------
Timestamps are appended to the beginning of the archive filename and separated by a hyphen. The default timestamp format is *YYYYMMDDhhmm*; the timezone used is Eastern Daylight Time and the hours and minutes are handled in 24-hour format.
